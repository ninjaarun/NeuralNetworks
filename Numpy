numpy.array

numpy.array(object, dtype=None, copy=True, order='K', subok=False, ndmin=0)

    Create an array.
    Parameters:	

    object : array_like

        An array, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose __array__ method returns an array, or any (nested) sequence.
    dtype : data-type, optional

        The desired data-type for the array. If not given, then the type will be determined as the minimum type required to hold the objects in the sequence. This argument can only be used to ‘upcast’ the array. For downcasting, use the .astype(t) method.
    copy : bool, optional

        If true (default), then the object is copied. Otherwise, a copy will only be made if __array__ returns a copy, if obj is a nested sequence, or if a copy is needed to satisfy any of the other requirements (dtype, order, etc.).
    order : {‘K’, ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘F’}, optional

        Specify the memory layout of the array. If object is not an array, the newly created array will be in C order (row major) unless ‘F’ is specified, in which case it will be in Fortran order (column major). If object is an array the following holds.
        order 	no copy 	copy=True
        ‘K’ 	unchanged 	F & C order preserved, otherwise most similar order
        ‘A’ 	unchanged 	F order if input is F and not C, otherwise C order
        ‘C’ 	C order 	C order
        ‘F’ 	F order 	F order

        When copy=False and a copy is made for other reasons, the result is the same as if copy=True, with some exceptions for A, see the Notes section. The default order is ‘K’.
    subok : bool, optional

        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).
    ndmin : int, optional

        Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting array should have. Ones will be pre-pended to the shape as needed to meet this requirement.

    Returns:	

    out : ndarray

        An array object satisfying the specified requirements.
